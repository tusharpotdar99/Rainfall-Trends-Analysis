## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizations of annual, monthly, and seasonal rainfall trends.
   - Insights into year-to-year and month-to-month variability.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Cleaning and preprocessing of rainfall data for consistency and accuracy.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Calculation of moving averages to smooth time series data.
   - Detection of anomalous years and months based on statistical thresholds.

4. **Clustering:**
   - Grouping years into clusters based on rainfall patterns.
   - Identification of similar rainfall behavior across years.

5. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Analysis of rainfall trends year-wise, month-wise, and season-wise.
   - Insights into long-term changes in rainfall distribution.

6. **Forecasting:**
   - Rainfall forecasting using the **Prophet** model.
   - Visualization of predictions with confidence intervals.

7. **Interactive App:**
   - Streamlit app to present analysis and forecasting results.
   - Features include:
     - Trend visualizations.
     - Forecast graphs with confidence intervals.
     - Anomalous year/month detection.
